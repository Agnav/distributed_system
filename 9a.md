### **Illustration of the Bully Algorithm for Electing a New Leader**  

The **Bully Algorithm** is a leader election algorithm used in **distributed systems** where processes have unique priorities (identifiers). The process with the highest priority is elected as the new leader. It is called the **Bully Algorithm** because the process with the highest priority "bullies" all lower-priority processes into accepting it as the leader.  

---

### **Steps of the Bully Algorithm**  
The algorithm works as follows:  

1. **Election Initiation**:  
   - A process detects the failure of the coordinator.  
   - It sends an **election message** to all processes with a **higher priority number** than itself.  

2. **Response Handling**:  
   - If **no higher-priority process** responds within a time \( T \), the initiating process assumes leadership and **broadcasts a coordinator message**.  
   - If at least one higher-priority process responds with an **OK message**, the initiating process **waits**, as the higher-priority process will handle the election.  

3. **Higher-Priority Processes Start Election**:  
   - The responding process starts its **own election**, looking for even **higher-priority** processes.  
   - This process continues until the highest-priority process is found.  

4. **Coordinator Announcement**:  
   - The highest-priority process **declares itself as the leader** by broadcasting a **coordinator message** to all other processes.  

5. **Recovery of a Previously Failed Coordinator**:  
   - If a previously failed process **recovers**, it will check if it has the highest priority.  
   - If so, it will initiate a new election and **take over** as the coordinator.

### **Illustration of the Bully Algorithm**  

#### **Example Scenario**
Consider **five processes** in a system with unique priority numbers:  
P1 (lowest) â†’ P2 â†’ P3 â†’ P4 â†’ P5 (highest).  

1. **Failure of Coordinator (P5 fails)**  
   - P3 detects the failure of P5 and initiates an election.  
   - P3 sends an **election message** to P4 and P5.  

2. **Response from Higher-Priority Process**  
   - P4 responds with an **OK message** (since P5 is down).  
   - P4 now initiates its own election by sending messages to P5.  

3. **P4 Wins Election**  
   - Since P5 is down, P4 **declares itself the new leader** and sends a **coordinator message** to all lower-priority processes (P1, P2, P3).  

4. **Recovery of P5**  
   - If P5 comes back online, it **initiates a new election**.  
   - Since it has the **highest priority**, it **becomes the new coordinator** and sends a **coordinator message**.

### **Liveness and Safety Analysis**  

âœ… **Liveness (Progress Guarantee)**  
- The algorithm ensures that a leader is always elected if there is at least one operational process.  
- The election **eventually completes**, as the highest-priority process will become the leader.  

âœ… **Safety (Correctness Guarantee)**  
- Only one leader is elected at a time.  
- The process with the highest priority **always wins** the election, ensuring correctness.  

ðŸ”´ **Limitations**  
- **High message overhead**: If many processes fail and restart, the number of election messages increases.  
- **Network congestion**: Multiple elections can occur simultaneously.  

---

### **Conclusion**  
The **Bully Algorithm** is an efficient leader election algorithm that ensures the **highest-priority** process always becomes the coordinator. It meets **liveness** (ensures progress) and **safety** (ensures correctness), but it can have high message complexity in systems with frequent failures.
