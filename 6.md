### **Definition of Vector Time**  

**Vector Time** is a logical clock system used in **distributed computing** to capture **causal relationships** between events. It is an improvement over **Lamport’s Scalar Clock**, as it **preserves causality** between events in a distributed system.  

In **Vector Clocks**, each process maintains a **vector of timestamps**, where:  
- Each element in the vector represents the **logical clock value of a particular process**.  
- A process updates its own timestamp and also updates its view of other processes based on received messages.  

Each process **Pᵢ** maintains a **vector clock Vᵢ** where:  
- **Vᵢ[j]** represents **Pᵢ’s knowledge of Pⱼ's logical time**.

### **Conclusion**  
**Vector Time** ensures **accurate tracking of causality** in distributed systems. It is **strongly consistent**, can be used for **event counting**, and allows comparison between events to determine **causal dependencies**. However, its major drawback is **space complexity**, as each process must maintain a vector of size **equal to the number of processes**.
