### Causal Dependency in Distributed Executions Using Lamport’s Happened-Before Relation

In a distributed system, processes execute independently and communicate through message passing. The concept of causal dependency between events is fundamental to understanding the order in which events occur and how they influence each other. This causal dependency is formally defined using **Lamport’s Happened-Before Relation (→)**.

#### **Definition of Lamport’s Happened-Before Relation**
Lamport’s **happened-before** relation, denoted as \( e_i \to e_j \), establishes a partial ordering of events in a distributed system and defines causal dependencies. The relation is defined as follows:

1. **Same Process Rule**: If two events occur in the same process, their execution order defines their causal relation.
   \[
   e_{i_x} \to e_{i_{x+1}}, \quad \text{if } e_{i_x} \text{ occurs before } e_{i_{x+1}} \text{ in the same process}.
   \]

2. **Message Sending Rule**: If an event sends a message, and another event receives it, the sending event causally precedes the receiving event.
   \[
   \text{send}(m) \to \text{receive}(m)
   \]

3. **Transitivity Rule**: If an event \( e_i \) happened before an event \( e_j \), and \( e_j \) happened before an event \( e_k \), then \( e_i \) happened before \( e_k \).
   \[
   e_i \to e_j \text{ and } e_j \to e_k \Rightarrow e_i \to e_k
   \]

#### **Causal Precedence in Distributed Execution**
The **happened-before** relation induces a **partial order** of events in a distributed computation. If \( e_i \to e_j \), then event \( e_j \) is directly or transitively dependent on event \( e_i \). This ordering ensures that the effects of causally related events are respected during execution.

In a **space-time diagram**, the flow of information is represented as:
- **Horizontal lines** represent process execution.
- **Dots** represent events.
- **Slanted arrows** indicate message transfers.
- **Causal paths** exist when an event affects another event.

For example, if event \( e_{1,1} \) in process \( P1 \) sends a message to event \( e_{3,3} \) in process \( P3 \), we have:
\[
e_{1,1} \to e_{3,3}
\]

#### **Logical vs. Physical Concurrency**
- **Logically Concurrent Events**: Two events \( e_i \) and \( e_j \) are concurrent (denoted as \( e_i || e_j \)) if neither happened before the other.
- **Physically Concurrent Events**: Events that occur at the same instant in physical time.

Even though events may not occur at the same time physically, logically concurrent events may still be assumed to have happened simultaneously.

### **Conclusion**
The **happened-before** relation captures the causal dependencies between events in a distributed system. It ensures that events respect causal ordering, preventing inconsistencies in execution. This relation is crucial for synchronization, message ordering, and consistency in distributed computing.
